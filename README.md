A professional, AI-ready web development boilerplate built with the latest technologies. Designed for high performance, smooth animations, and rapid development cycles.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15+ (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

- **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Optimization:** Next/Image & Next/Font

## 📁 Project Structure

```text
├── app/               # App Router: Pages, layouts, and global styles
├── ai-agents/         # AI-first documentation & instruction sets
├── components/        # Reusable UI components (React)
├── lib/               # Shared utilities, hooks, and constants
├── public/            # Static assets (images, fonts, SVGs)
└── next.config.ts     # Next.js configuration
```

### Key Directories

- **`app/`**: Contains the core routing logic. `page.tsx` is your entry point, and `layout.tsx` manages the root structure and metadata.
- **`components/`**: Modularized UI elements. Follows a "shadcn-inspired" architecture for maximum customizability.
- **`ai-agents/`**: **The Brain**. This folder contains detailed instruction sets (`instructions.md`), design systems (`design-Instructions.md`), and state tracking (`AGENTS.md`) for AI coding assistants. This ensures consistent development when using tools like Antigravity, Cursor, or Copilot.
- **`lib/`**: Contains shared logic like the `cn` utility for Tailwind class merging.

## 🤖 AI-Ready Workflow

This boilerplate is specifically optimized for AI-driven development.
1. **Context First**: Always point your AI agent to the `ai-agents/` folder.
2. **Design Alignment**: Use `design-Instructions.md` to ensure the AI adheres to the brand's color palette, typography, and motion system.
3. **Persistent State**: The `AGENTS.md` file tracks progress and architectural decisions across sessions.


## 🎨 Branding & Design for this beautiful project

ADC is all about gathering, drumming, dancing and connecting through the passion for West African culture.

This boilerplate ships with a modern, high-contrast design system:
- **Primary Colors**: Charcoal (#121212), White (#FFFFFF), and Lime (#C4D656).
- **Typography**: Gardaempty (Display) and Inter (Body).
- **Motion**: Signature "Drum Pulse" reveal animations.
